# Techcareer-Home-Redesign
This project aims to redesign and reorganize Techcareer.net's homepage to make it user-friendly, modern, and functional. Within the scope of the project, it is planned to improve the existing design, increase user experience, and facilitate in-site navigation.

# Features 
- Presentation of TCNET Products: A short presentation and orientation of all products available under TCNET (all events accepting open applications, job postings, trainings, community) on the home page.
- Redirection to Blog Page: Adding links from the home page to the blog page.
- Glossary Page Redirection: Adding links from the homepage to the glossary page.
- Leadform: A form on the homepage where users can leave their contact details.
- Participant Feedback: Adding a section to listen to users' feedback.
- Why TCNET: A short (2-3 sentence) explanation and visual presentation of why TCNET should be preferred.

# Acceptance Criteria
- You can use lorem ipsum texts.
- For the pages you will add, just add a redirect link. For example, it is enough to click on "see all" where you describe the training and redirect to techcareer.net/courses.
- It is enough to have the first three fields on each page (training, job postings, events). If one of these three is clicked, it goes to the relevant page.
- Our design system structure should remain the same.
- Brand colors should remain the same
- Header and footer must remain the same.
